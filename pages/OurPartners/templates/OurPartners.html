                Beit MICHA is a multidisciplinary center which meets the therapeutic and educational needs of children with hearing loss from birth to first grade. The family plays a central role in the rehabilitation process and the parents are full partners in their childâ€™s intervention program. The Center operates in conjunction with governmental agencies: The Ministry of Health, The Ministry of Education and The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
                Our educational vision:

                To provide each hard of hearing child with the tools to acquire communication, language and speech skills and to give each child an equal opportunity to develop his or her potential and fully integrate into society.
